        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">You could get Pension Credit as a couple</h2>
      
        <p>Pension credit could top up your State Pension to £255.25 a week.</p>
          <p>
         To qualify, your partner must have also have reached State Pension age. Or
         one of you is over State Pension age and getting Housing Benefit.</p>
         
            
          <p>How much Pension Credit you get depends on:</p>
          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>your joint income being less than £255.55 a week</li>
          <li>the amount in savings and property you have</li>
          <li>if you have a disability</li>
          <li>if you're a carer</li>
          </ul>
          <p>If you’re eligible, Pension Credit could also help you get other benefits too. For example, reduced Council Tax, Housing Benefit to help pay your rent and free prescriptions.</p>
         <p>You have to claim Pension Credit. </p>
