          <li>your income being less than £167.25 a week</li>
          <li>the amount in savings and property you have</li>

          <li>if you're a carer</li>
          </ul>
          <p>If you’re eligible, Pension Credit could also help you get other benefits too. For example, reduced Council Tax, Housing Benefit to help pay your rent and free prescriptions.</p>
         <p>You have to claim Pension Credit. </p>
